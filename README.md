Palmoria Group is a manufacturing company based in Nigeria and concerned with issues
relating to gender inequality in its 3 regions. The situation was further highlited by the recent media 
post casting their image in a bad light. 

This report is an attempt to show the true situation with data.

Two data sets where provided. One excel file and a csv file.
The excel file is provided thus [Palmoria Group Bonus Rules.xlsx](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/21568456/Palmoria.Group.Bonus.Rules.xlsx)

While the csv file is 
[Uploading Palmoria Group emp-data[Palmoria Group Bonus Rules.xlsx](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/21568459/Palmoria.Group.Bonus.Rules.xlsx).csvâ€¦]()

The data from both excel and csv were cleaned and then visualized.

I struggled badly to add my vsualisations to this page since Power BI cannot save PDF fil,so the output and presentation was not properly captured here.
I later found a way to save pdf to pictures hence the output below.
